### We are using google w2v for featurizing text data in our baseline model
* Download the GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin file from the below url and place it under titans_milestone3\codebase\googlew2v
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leadbest/googlenewsvectorsnegative300

* All the code requires GPU Processing for fast execution so all the files need to be uploaded to Google drive for the execution

### Please follow the below steps for running all the models
* Load codebase folder in the google drive to run it in google colab
* Put the codebase folder in the main directory of the drive to run all the files without updating any path inside the code
* Go to codebase\Task-SI run each cell sequentially of DataPreparationSI.ipynb
* Go to codebase\Task-TC run each cell sequentially of DataPreparationTC.ipynb

### Running Baseline models
* Go to codebase\Task-SI run each cell sequentially of SI_baseline.ipynb
* Go to codebase\Task-SI run each cell sequentially of TC_baseline.ipynb

### Running Final models
* Go to codebase\Task-SI run each cell sequentially of SI_Final.ipynb.ipynb
* Go to codebase\Task-SI run each cell sequentially of TC_Final.ipynb

### All the results for both the task will be stored in below folders in proper format
* task-SI - codebase\Result-SI
* task-TC - codebase\Result-TC
